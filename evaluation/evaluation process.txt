Process of the Evaluation:

1. The participants are informed about the foot-based recognition sensor, the possible foot movements and the mapped actions.
2. The participants are given a set of tasks to perform:
	1. Find a particular graph.
	2. Zoom in on sthm.

// The System records how many action are measured.
3. The participants evaluate:
	0.1. Which was the easiest task for you?
	0.2. Which was the hardest task for you?	or each tasks difficulty to perform	1 - 5
	1. Precision of sensor: 1 - 5
	2. Usability of sensor: 1 - 5
	3. Would you use it in your everyday work? (Given the sensor would be smaller, wireless and with a good battery) 1 - 5
	2. Number of FN and FP actions: #



4. Afterwards the following data is recorded for the evaluation:
	1. F-Measure		( (2*precision*recall) / (precision + recall) )
		precision 	( (t.a. - FP) / (t.a.)
		recall 		( (t.a. - FP) / (t.a. - FP + FN)
	


// Problems: Working with the KPMG dashboards, not all actions we programm can be used/demonstrated.
// t.a.: total actions,  TP: true positive, FP: false positives, TF: true negative, FN: false negative (number of actions the user made, that were not registered by the system)
// precision 	( (t.a. - FP) / (t.a.)
// recall 	( (t.a. - FP) / (t.a. - FP + FN)

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR THE TESTLEITUNG:
FNs, false negatives, have to be recorded per hand. The system does not record them.
At the end they have to be added to the total number of actions.
