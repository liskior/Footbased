Process of the Evaluation:

1. The participants are informed about the footbased recognition sensor, the possible foot movements and the mapped actions.
2. The participants are given a set of tasks to perfrom:
	1. Find a particular graph.
	2. Zoom in on sthm.

// The System records how many action are measured.
3. The participants evaluate:
	1. Usability of sensor: 1 - 10
	2. Number of FN and FP actions: #
		
				

4. Afterwards the following data is recorded for the evaluation:
	1. F-Measure		( (2*precision*recall) / (precision + recall) )
		precision 	( (t.a. - FP) / (t.a.)
		recall 		( (t.a. - FP) / (t.a. - FP + FN)
	


// Problems: Working with the KPMG dashboards, not all actions we programm can be used/demonstrated.
// t.a.: total actions,  TP: true positive, FP: false positives, TF: true negative, FN: false negative (number of actions the user made, that were not registered by the system)
// precision 	( (t.a. - FP) / (t.a.)
// recall 	( (t.a. - FP) / (t.a. - FP + FN)
