Foot moving inwards is difficult for the human to execute, but also a little
more difficult for the machine to register. With inwards movements, first time
users tend to do a pre-move which was not present when training.

Ideally, videos of movements should be shown. Verbal definition is not enought.
With verbal definition only, users execute the movement too slow or without
enough magnitude, or with too much magnitude.
